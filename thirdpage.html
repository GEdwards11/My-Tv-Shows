	<h3> EUPHORIA</h3>
	<div>
	<p> If you have seen 13ReasonsWhy, you will enjoy Euphoria! Euphoria is an American teen drama television series created by Sam Levinson, loosely based on the Israeli miniseries of the same name. Euphoria follows a group of high school students through their experiences of sex, drugs, friendships, love, identity and trauma. I enjoy series that portray 21st century teenage issues! This series won a grammy and season 2 is in production, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it is moving a little slow. SO for the super fans, we agre not going to be getting the full season ,sadly!, but they are going to release some episodes in December!! I am beyond excited!! Please check it out if you havent already! Let me know waht you think...</p>
